### Selected Projects
- **AI-Powered Photo Curation (PicSavior):** Built a macOS/iOS app in **SwiftUI + CoreML + Vision** with hybrid models (OpenCV, DeepFace, TensorFlow NIMA), achieving **88% accuracy vs. human benchmarks** and cutting manual curation by 85%.  
- **Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) Calculator:** Designed a Python/Flask tool to compute OFI from order book snapshots, visualizing liquidity shifts and backtesting predictive signals in high-frequency trading.  
- **Equity Forecasting Engine:** Developed a dashboard with **Prophet, yFinance, and Streamlit**, delivering interactive time-series forecasts and insights for equity markets.  
- **AI Face Detection System:** Implemented real-time recognition pipelines in **Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Flask, and PyQt5** with modular CLI + GUI support.  
- **Self-Driving Car Simulation:** Created a 2D autonomous driving environment with a **custom neural network + genetic algorithms**, modeling kinematics, collision dynamics, and real-time navigation.
